Machine Learning Basics

    Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence that enables systems to learn and improve from experience without being explicitly programmed. It focuses on developing computer programs that can access data and use it to learn for themselves.

    Types of Machine Learning:

    Supervised Learning: Learning with labeled data

    Unsupervised Learning: Finding patterns in unlabeled data

    Reinforcement Learning: Learning through rewards and penalties

    Applications include image recognition, speech processing, and recommendation systems
